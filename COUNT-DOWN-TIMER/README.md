# 10-JavaScript-Projects

# PROJECT-NUMBER-ONE

# COUNT-DOWN-TIMER

This is the first project in the series. I will be doing the count down timer.

I enjoyed coding this project along with Florin Pop.

You can swap around the images to get different layouts.
With 'snow2' you need to change the 'align-items: center;'.

Have fun.
